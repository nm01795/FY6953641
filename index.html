  <h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
This paper presents compares liquid methane (LOX/CH4) and kerosene (LOX/RP-1) as rocket fuels for
reusable booster engines. The study evaluates the performance, e.g specific impulse, density,
combustion temp and environmental factors. Based on published studies, and compares the feasibility
of using these fuels in reusable rockets by using real life examples of rockets that use these fuel 
sources where methane is a more modern alternative.

  <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
The fuel that a rocket engine uses determines the efficiency, the cost and reusability of rockets. Firstly, 
Kerosene particularly RP-1, has been the main fuel source in the past which has powered the most popular 
launch vehicles such as the Saturn V and Soyuz rockets.Whereas Methane is now becoming a highly used fuel 
source in the space industry for the next generation of rockets especially reusable rockets for example
Space X’s starship and Blue Origin’s New Glenn, Where reusability is very important as a factor for modern
rockets due to the possibilities of flight to other planets such as mars and the possibility for synthesis
of these fuels on extraterrestrial planets.

  These performances are theoretical. [6] Dunn, B., n.d. ‘Rocket Fuel Table’.


Efficiency:
The Theoretical performance data measured in Isp (where Specific impulse is the ratio of thrust to
propellant weight flow, calculated as Isp = F / (m.g0), and is a measure of engine efficiency.) shows that
Methane is slightly more efficient as it has an isp that is 10s above that of kerosene, which means that
it produces more thrust while using less fuel in a ratio, in which a higher thrust is very important as
it allows the rocket to push through the thick atmosphere quicker. Therefore, methane beats RP-1 by pure
efficiency however there are other factors that affect the efficiency of the whole launch

The density of Methane is approximately half that of kerosene meaning that when kerosene is used fuel
tanks can be smaller therefore the mass of the rocket can be reduced this will improve the efficiency
of the launch system as less mass means the thrust provided can propel the rocket further. Methane
also has a higher oxidiser to fuel ratio, meaning more oxidiser is needed to combust with the methane
for the best combustion meaning that the rocket will be heavier at liftoff meaning a less efficient
launch compared to RP-1.

RP-1 also requires more complicated fuel tanks, as RP-1 fuel needs to be externally pressurised by inert
gases such as helium, therefore increasing the weight and the complexity of the design to keep the tank
pressurized by having additional valves, tanks and components, Whereas methane is self-pressurised due
to a portion of the fuel being allowed to vaporize hence pressurizing the fuel tank, this eliminates 
any extra components. On the other hand, Methane is a cryogenic fuel so must be kept at very cold temperatures
of less than −161°C which means that the methane fuel tanks require extra mass for insulation systems to 
minimise heat gain from the environment. Where the RP-1 fuel is stored at room temp so requires no extra
components, making the rockets lighter

Enviromental impact:
Methane also provides cleaner combustion due to its by product being H20 and carbon dioxide where water is the
main byproduct, while kerosene being a hydrocarbon produces byproducts such as carbon dioxide and soot meaning
that the byproducts can build up inside the rocket engine, this can reduce performance and can block clog
critical engine components therefore for reusable rockets kerosene is less desirable, the soot must also be
cleaned of regularly if the engine were to be reused, which costs valuable time and money to those responsible
for the engines, Therefore reduces reusability. The carbon dioxide emissions can be dangerous if there is too
much in the atmosphere as it is a greenhouse gas therefore causes climate change. RP-1 also releases nitrogen
oxides which also contribute to air pollution.

Manufacturing:
RP-1 fuel is a refined form of kerosene so is made from refining crude oils which is expensive and takes a long
time, whereas methane is a simple molecule which can be easily produced with the Sabatier Reaction
(CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O) (C. Vogt et al., 2019. The Renaissance of the Sabatier Reaction and Its Applications
on Earth and in Space) which is a process that reacts hydrogen and carbon dioxide where these are very common
molecules. This process can also be executed on other planets to produce methane fuel for example mars where
the carbon dioxide rich atmosphere can be used to do the process, whereas the process of the refinement of
crude oils for RP-1 requires heavy machinery that would not be worth to bring on interplanetary missions,
Therefore methane has a clear advantage over RP-1.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
In Conclusion, The choice between RP-1 fuel and methane fuel plays a vital role in determining all the factors
of modern launch vehicles, where RP-1(kerosene) has the longest history of powering rockets its limitations 
make reusability not ideal with RP-1, where methane on the other hand offers more benefits when it comes to
reusability making it the most popular fuel for reusable rockets nowadays, where the industry is shifting 
towards this, therefore methane is likely to become dominant in the future of rocket engineering.
